Hello! I'm Donald.

I'm a software engineer currently working at [HP][] where I work on improving
Python packaging, mostly through [pip][] and [PyPI][]. I'm also heavily
involved in the Python community where I am a core developer for [CPython][],
[Python Package Index][PyPI], [pip][], [virtualenv][], and a member of the
[Python Infrastructure Team][python-infra].

[HP]: http://www.hpcloud.com/
[CPython]: https://www.python.org/
[PyPI]: https://pypi.python.org/
[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/
[virtualenv]: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/
[python-infra]: https://status.python.org/

I'm currently working a lot on the the tooling and infrastructure for
packaging, distributing, and installing Python based software and libraries.
You can often find me participating on the [distutils-sig][] mailing list where
we attempt to make the world a saner place for packaging.
