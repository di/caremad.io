title: How has Python Packaging Failed You?

Python packaging has a lot of problems. I am one of the people who are working
hard to fix those problems. However *I* have a problem. I know too much about
packaging and it's internals and I've lost sight of what problems face actual
users. So this is my open call to anyone and everyone who uses or has ever
used the packaging toolchain in Python.

What doesn't work for you? What have you had to work around? Do you teach new
people? What doesn't work for them? What about packaging is the most painful
for you? How can packaging be made to serve your needs?

If you're willing to share your experiences with me just drop me a line at
